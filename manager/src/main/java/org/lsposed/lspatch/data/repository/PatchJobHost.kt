/**
 * The one patch job in flight, and everything watching it.
 *
 * Hosted on the application scope rather than in the patch screen's ViewModel. A patch takes tens of seconds and cannot
 * be cancelled part-way without leaving a half-written apk, so tying it to a screen meant the screen had to refuse to
 * be left -- the old flow swallowed the back gesture outright while patching. Here, leaving is simply leaving: the job
 * carries on, the Manage screen can show that it is running, and coming back re-attaches to it.
 *
 * Patching and installing are deliberately separate acts. `start` finishes at [PatchStep.Patched] and waits; a
 * thirty-second wait must not end in an unbidden system install prompt under a button the user pressed labelled
 * "Patch".
