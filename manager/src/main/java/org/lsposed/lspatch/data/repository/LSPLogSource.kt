/**
 * LSPatch's Shizuku-backed implementation of the shared Logs screen's [LogSource].
 *
 * Where Vector streams a rotating file from a root daemon, LSPatch has [ManagerResidentService] keep a shell-side
 * collector running continuously (see [ShizukuService]): it fans one live logcat into two rotating, timestamped stream
 * files the shell user owns — `verbose` (every line) and `framework`. This reads those parts back — so the screen's
 * part chevrons are real rotations, and logs captured while the screen was closed are still there — falling back to a
 * one-shot `logcat -d` snapshot only in the gap before the collector has produced anything.
 *
 * The framework stream is routed at collection time by uid alone: a line joins it when it comes from the manager, a
 * patched app or a module (their uids pushed to the collector), or is fatal whoever wrote it. So the read side just
 * parses the already-routed part — no per-line package resolution, and no tag to second-guess.
