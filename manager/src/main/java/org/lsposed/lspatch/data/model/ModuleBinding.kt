/**
 * One module as a patch sees it, whatever mode the patch is in.
 *
 * The manager's existing currency for "a package" is `LSPPackageManager.AppInfo`, which wraps a live
 * `ApplicationInfo` and looks its icon up in a map keyed by installed packages. Neither holds for a
 * module baked into someone else's apk: it has no `ApplicationInfo` in the system, and asking for
 * its icon throws. Yet that is exactly the module an Integrated app's detail page has to list, with
 * the same name, version, API badge and description an installed one gets -- otherwise a patched
 * app's own modules read as second-class next to the installed ones.
 *
 * So this carries the answers rather than a handle to look them up with: the fields are already
 * resolved, [apkPath] points at something readable now, and [icon] is null when there genuinely is
 * no icon rather than a promise that throws.
