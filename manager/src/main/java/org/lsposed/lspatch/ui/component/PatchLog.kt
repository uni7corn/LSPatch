/**
 * The patcher's output, live -- the diagnostic, not the headline.
 *
 * This used to be the whole of what a patch looked like: a monospace console that scrolled by for
 * half a minute and then stopped, with nothing in it saying whether that was progress or a hang.
 * It is now something the reader opens when they want it, and what it says is worth reading
 * precisely because it is no longer the only thing on offer.
 *
 * Shaped on Vector's own installer log so a long-running job reads the same in both apps: the tail
 * is followed only while the reader is already at the tail. Lines do not wrap by default -- a
 * patcher line is mostly an absolute path, and wrapping turns one into four -- but [wrap] offers it
 * for the case a long message is easier read wrapped than scrolled.
