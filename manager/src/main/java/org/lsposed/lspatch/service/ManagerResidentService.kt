/**
 * Keeps the manager present for as long as anything on this device depends on it.
 *
 * A patched app reaches the manager the moment it starts, and a module app is handed its service by the manager pushing
 * one; both are answered late, or not at all, if the manager's process has been reaped in the meantime. A foreground
 * service does not make the process unkillable — nothing an ordinary app can do makes it unkillable, and a force-stop
 * ends it whatever it is doing — but it does move the process out of the bucket ordinary memory pressure empties first,
 * which covers the common case at the cost of one silent notification.
 *
 * Two jobs ride on that presence. Log collection, which needs the process alive anyway because the Shizuku binding
 * lives in it, is supervised here as before: the shell-side `logcat -f` collector is started once Shizuku is granted
 * and restarted if it dies. And, when the person has asked for it, the shell-side watchdog is armed — see
 * [ShizukuApi.startManagerWatchdog], which is the only part of this that survives the manager's own death.
 *
 * The service is deliberately cheap: once everything is healthy the loop is a binder round trip every few seconds that
 * does nothing, and the notification sits at minimum importance with no badge.
