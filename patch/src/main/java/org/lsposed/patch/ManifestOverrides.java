/**
 * Optional overrides applied to the patched app's manifest.
 *
 * The patcher already rewrites a handful of manifest attributes as a side effect of injecting the
 * loader (the component factory, the debuggable flag, a minimum SDK floor). This groups the ones a
 * caller may *choose* to change, so the manifest surface is one typed object rather than a growing
 * list of loose parameters -- adding another overridable attribute is a field here and a line in
 * {@link ApkPatcher}, nothing more.
 *
 * Every scalar field is nullable and means "leave as the original app had it" when null, so the
 * empty overrides are a no-op and an unpatched attribute is never touched. {@link #addedPermissions}
 * follows the same rule with an empty list.
